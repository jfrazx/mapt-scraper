# Scraper

An attempt to scrape Packt/Mapt pages using CasperJS and play with Node child processes.

May eventually use an alternate scraper as CasperJS is no longer maintained.  
Haven't touched this is some time, it mostly worked, but could possibly do absolutely nothing worthwhile.

## Installation

You will need CasperJS, SlimerJS, Node, MongoDB, Yarn and I'm probably forgetting something ...

Install Node dependencies, setup environment variables in `.env.example`

## Run

`yarn start`
